# What is a List?

### 1. A *list* is a collection of items in a particular order. You can make a list that includes the letters of the alphabet, the digits from 0-9, or the names of all the people in your family.

### 2. In Python, square brackets ([ ]) indicate a list, and individual elements in the list are separated by commas. 

- Here's a simple example of a list that contains a few kinds of bicycles. This can be found in `bicycles.py`:

```
bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
print(bicycles)
```

Output:

```
jonathan@dockerhost-01:~/python_crash-course/chapter_03/intro_lists$ python3 bicycles.py
['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
```
