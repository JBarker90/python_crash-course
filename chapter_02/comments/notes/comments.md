# Comments

### 1. A *comment* allows you to write notes in English within your programs. They are an extremely useful feature in most programming languages. 

### 2. How Do You Write Comments?

- In Python, the hash mark (#) indicates a comment. Anything following a hash mark in your corde is ignored by the Python interpreter. 

- For example, this is in the `comment.py` file

```
# Say hello to everyone.

print("Hello Python people!")
```

Output:

```
jonathan@dockerhost-01:~/python_crash-course/chapter_02/comments$ python3 comment.py
Hello Python people!
```

### 3. What Kind of Comments Should You Write?

- The main reason to write comments is to explain what your code is supposed to do and how you are making it work. 

- Writing clear, concise comments in your code is one of the most beneficial habits you can form as a new programmer.
