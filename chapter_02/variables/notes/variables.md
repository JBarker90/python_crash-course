# Variables

### 1. What Really happens When you Run `hello_world.py`

- Even when running a simple program like `hello_world.py` (which is just a print statement), Python does a fair amount of work
- When you run a file using the `.py` extension, this will indicate that the file is a Python program.
- Then, the editor will run the file through the `Python interpreter`, which reads through the program and determines what each word in the program means. 

### 2. What are Variables and What do they do?

- In the program we can add a new line called `message`
- This will set a value to the variable called `message`

```
message = "Hello Python World!"
print(message)
```
